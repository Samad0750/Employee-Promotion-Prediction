🎯 Successfully Completed My End-to-End ML Project: "Employee Promotion Prediction" 🔥
→ Built to predict who’s next in line for a promotion — with real-world HR data!

📦 Dataset: 50,000+ employee records
📚 Goal: Predict whether an employee will be promoted based on past performance & attributes

This project wasn't just about building a model — it was about solving a real business challenge using data. Here's what I did:

🚀 Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Pipeline:

🔹 1. Data Ingestion
Loaded and structured a large dataset with >50K records, prepping it for exploration and modeling.

🔹 2. Advanced EDA

Identified a highly imbalanced target variable

Discovered key trends influencing promotion decisions

Brought data to life through smart visual storytelling

🔹 3. Data Cleaning

Tackled missing values, noisy data, and inconsistent formatting

Ensured high-quality input for a high-performing model

🔹 4. Feature Engineering

Created meaningful features from raw columns

Boosted model interpretability and performance

🔹 5. Outlier Detection & Treatment

Spotted anomalies using IQR and visual methods

Used capping and transformation techniques to reduce skew

🔹 6. Data Visualization
Used a variety of plots to get deep insights:

📊 Bar plots & pie charts

📉 Histograms

🐱 Catplots for categorical insights

🎯 Distribution plots to study feature symmetry

🔹 7. Label Encoding
Transformed categorical features into numerical ones for seamless model training

🔹 8. Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE
Applied SMOTE to ensure balanced learning & fair prediction on minority class

🔹 9. Train-Test Split + Model Building
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
✅ Test Accuracy: 87%
✅ Validation Accuracy: 88%
High performance + no overfitting = major win 🏆

🔹 10. Final Predictions
Built a clean pipeline to predict promotions in future data with confidence

🎓 Skills Applied & Strengthened:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn)

Machine Learning Model Development

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Engineering

Handling Imbalanced Datasets (SMOTE)
